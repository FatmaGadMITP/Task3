# Text Processor

This repository contains a Python script (`main.py`) that performs various text processing tasks on the contents of a given input file (`input.txt`). The results are saved to an output file (`output.txt`). Below are the detailed functionalities of the script.

## Features

1. **Count Words and Sentences**
   - Counts the number of words in the text.
   - Counts the number of sentences based on the occurrence of `.`, `!`, `?`, and `,`.

2. **Count Digits**
   - Counts the number of digits in the text.

3. **Transpose Words**
   - Reverses the characters in each word of the text.

4. **Transform Case**
   - Converts lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

5. **Convert to ASCII Codes**
   - Converts each character in the text to its ASCII code representation.

6. **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**
   - Applies simple Run-Length Encoding (RLE) to the text for basic compression.

## File Structure

- `input.txt`: The input file containing the text to be processed.
- `output.txt`: The output file where the results are saved.
- `main.py`: The Python script performing the text processing.
